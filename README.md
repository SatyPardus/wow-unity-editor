A very much work in progress thingy for WoW 3.3.5

My goal is to be able to read and write all WoW 3.3.5 related files at some point, and then build tools around them.

Right now this project only loads MPQ, ADT, WDT and WMO's. BLP is third party for now.

Implementation of the above may not be complete.


This project is only for fun and not to compete with any other projects out there.
